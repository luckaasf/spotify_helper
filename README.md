# Playlist randomizer

## goal: create a random playlist (100 tracks max) based on a users form (genre, rating, etc...)

### For now i just made some changes to the [tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/howtos/web-app-profile) made by the spotify developers, I'm also using the bootstrap framework for css
